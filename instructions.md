# Instructions for authors

## Your abstract

### Contents
We strongly encourage the authors to take into account the comments made by the reviewers. 

We invite them to pay attention to two dimensions that are frequently underdeveloped in abstracts: 
* It is not uncommon for the historical research question to be stated too quickly, in favor of a description of the technical challenges or the source of the data. As this is a historical conference, presentations are expected to be based on a historical problematization and not just a technical demonstration. Why is it interesting to apply network analysis to these sources? What makes it different from other methods in this particular case?
* Formal network analysis is the common denominator of all papers, so the abstract should make it as clear as possible what type of analysis is being carried out, and if possible not describe the network in purely metaphorical terms. What model is being used and why? What are vertices and edges? What do these modeling decisions imply for your subsequent historical interpretation?

### Formal
The word limit is now higher, to allow those who wish to say a little more. We also invite you to revise your abstract so that it can be published in advance of the event on the conference website and archived on Zenodo with a permanent DOI.

* Maximum **word count: 2000** (including bibliographical references and notes)
* Deadline for abstract revision: **April 15, 2024**
* Citations should use the **Chicago Manual of Style** 17th Edition Author Date style (author-date in the text, then full reference at the end)
* Please include (at least) **one image** in your abstract. If you haven't produced a network visualization, please choose another image that you feel is appropriate to convey your network.

### Technical details
* Please modify your abstract directly **in the conference management platform** https://hnr2024.sciencesconf.org/(you simply modify your initial submission).
* No need to create a PDF, just put everything in the **full-text field**.
* Add your **images** as attachments (in the "File(s)" stage of the interface)
* We'll take care of the final, unified layout of all the abstracts, as well as publishing them online.

## Your registration
As the conference takes place in person in Lausanne, we need at least one person per communication to be present on site.
* **Register at least one author** as "present in Lausanne in person" in the "Registration" form on the conference management platform (https://hnr2024.sciencesconf.org/) **by April 15, 2024**. This allows us to finalize the program, knowing who will actually be there.
* Co-authors and other participants have until June 30 to register.
* As you know the conference is free of charge but does not cover travel or accommodation expenses for participants.
* You can find further practical information for planning your trip to Lausanne here: [Practical informations]([/practical])
