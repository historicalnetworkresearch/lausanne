# Network Analysis Workshops
Historical objects are fertile ground for network analysis, since they often consist of complex situations in which actors, places, organisations, concepts, etc. are intertwined.
With the help of internationally renowned experts, the aim of this event is to discuss in greater depth our uses of network visualisation (workshop 1) and to discover a tool developed specifically with the needs of historians in mind (workshop 2). 

This day precedes the HNR2024 conference and takes place at the same venue (Synathlon building, University of Lausanne, see [practical info](practical)). It closes with the opening plenary session, a keynote lecture by Mathieu Jacomy, to which workshop participants are of course welcome.

## Registration
To ensure that the workshops run smoothly, registration is separate from the conference registration. Those who have already registered for the conference must therefore also complete the form below. It is of course possible to attend the workshops without taking part in the conference itself afterwards.

Please note that as places are limited, your registration is final. Once the number of registrations exceeds the capacity of the in-person workshop, you will be placed on a waiting list and informed a few weeks in advance if a place becomes available. It is therefore important to keep us informed if you cancel your registration.

Anyone is welcome to take part, and there's no need to have any previous knowledge of network analysis.
