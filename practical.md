# Practical informations

## Registration
The conference is free of charge. Please note that the conference does not cover travel or accommodation expenses for participants.

Registration will open in spring 2024.

## Venue

The conference takes place in the Synathlon building, on the campus of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. 

See [general map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uyvhtU5re6MYrhiYA) and [campus map](https://planete.unil.ch/?batiment=SYN)

It's just 200 meters from the shores of Lake Geneva, whose beaches stretch for several kilometers: don't forget your bathing suit!

There are several food options on campus, in nearby buildings (5-8 minutes' walk). A meal usually costs around CHF 12-15.

## Transportation

The University of Lausanne campus is well served by the M1 metro line. The journey takes about ten minutes from the city center (Lausanne-Flon stop) to the university (UNIL-Chamberonne stop).

## Online participation

The conference is an on-site event, but streaming of sessions is planned.
