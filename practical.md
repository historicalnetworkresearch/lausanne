## The conference
### Registration
The conference is free of charge. Please note that the conference does not cover travel or accommodation expenses for participants.

### Venue

The conference takes place in the Synathlon building, on the campus of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. 

See [general map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uyvhtU5re6MYrhiYA) and [campus map](https://planete.unil.ch/?batiment=SYN)

It's just 200 meters from the shores of Lake Geneva, whose beaches stretch for several kilometers: don't forget your bathing suit!

There are several food options on campus, in nearby buildings (5-8 minutes' walk). A meal usually costs around CHF 8-15, a sandwich around CHF 5-9.

### Online participation

The conference is an on-site event, but streaming of sessions is planned. 

## Lausanne
### Transportation

The University of Lausanne campus is well served by the M1 metro line. The journey takes about ten minutes from the city center (Lausanne-Flon stop) to the university (UNIL-Chamberonne stop) and costs CHF 3.70 (one-way full fare). Lausanne is well integrated into the rail network, with excellent TGV connections from Paris in the west, EuroCity from Milan in the east, and ICE from the north, via Basel or Zurich. The nearest international airport is in Geneva, a 45min-1h train ride from Lausanne. 

### Accommodation

The conference has no specific recommendations for accommodation. Note that Lausanne is a place where the mountains meet the lake, and the city is therefore very steep: give preference to accommodation close to the M2 metro line (the city's vertical spine). The campus is located outside the city, so there are few hotels directly on site, but the metro makes accommodation in the city absolutely possible.
